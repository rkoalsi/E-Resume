            <h3>Work Experience</h3>
            <p>I started working doing part time jobs at a fake Subway, known as Toasties for a couple of weeks when I went down to Goa. This was just an experience to understand what a nine-five job is really like.  </p>
            <p>Fast Forward to 2018, I worked at a smoke shop in Kuwait during my final year of school just to get a little cash on the side to maintain my outgoing monthly expenditures. Looking older than my peers really helped in this aspect. </p>
            <p>The next year I moved to Canada where I took up a part time job moving boxes at the commercial liquor shops, over here I really learnt the value of patience and the importance of punctuality.</p>
            <p>As of now, I am currently working in a start-up company called BarkButler, which designs and imports pet products from China. I am employed as a potential web developer for the time being.  </p>

            <h3>Education</h3>
            <h5>University of Ottawa</h5>
            <p>2018-2019</p>
            <p>I had initially taken a year's course for a double degree in mechanical engineering and computing technology, however I realized that this was not something I was ready to do for the rest of my life (mechanical engineering in particular). After which, I had dropped out of university and have taken a gap year to really figure out what I want to do. After careful consideration, I have realized that coding is the direction to head in. </p>
              <div class="feature-wrap">
            <h5>Delhi Public School (Kuwait)</h5>
            <p>2013-2018</p>
            <p>Since the 8<sup>th</sup> grade I was enrolled in Fahaheel Al-Watenieh Indian Private School (DPS Kuwait) where I had studied CBSE till the 12<sup>th</sup> grade. I have aquired an 8.2 CGPA in 10th grade and a 76% in 12th Grade (Science+Economics) </p>
